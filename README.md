# Package-Installation-Order
## A program to decide the order of the installation of packages on the basis of dependencies on one another.

### Problem Explanation:
Softwares need the installation of other packages before they can be installed ("dependent" on the existence of other packages). Though there are many package managers available in different OSes to make this task simpler, this program aims to sort those packages and find a suitable order to install them.
